Currently, there are several things supported by the default Http Client that are not-supported or implemented for the Java.net client.  These include:

1. Proxy Support.
1. Client Filters.
1. Http2.
1. Streaming support.
1. Multipart requests.

If you require any of these, we recommend you use the default Micronaut Http Client.
